Write a program to take input a line from stdin. You have to reverse every word of this line, except for the starting and ending line of the words. For example, for the following input:

we love coding in this world
the output is:

we lveo cnidog in tihs wlrod
every word has been reversed except it's first and last alphabet.
Input format:

first line contains the number of lines, n
this is followed by n lines
Output:

print each line such that the words are reversed as per the criteria above
Example Input:
5
hello all
this is a good
example
to show you how to reverse
a string
 
Output:
hlleo all 
tihs is a good 
elpmaxe 
to sohw you how to rsrevee 
a snirtg
